## About the Project

In this project, we configure our Battlesnake game while setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. We aim to streamline our development process by integrating **YouTrack** for issue management, ensuring that each sprint is efficient and well-organized. Through this project, we will:
- Learn how to use **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and delivery.
- Track our work and sprints using **YouTrack**.
- Develop our Battlesnake game following agile methodologies.
- Reflect on our progress and deliver comprehensive reports on the development lifecycle.

This project is configured to run CI pipelines using Github Actions, ensuring that:
- Code is linted with ESLint.
- All tests are automatically run on every push and pull request.

## Technologies

This project makes use of the following technologies:
- **Battlesnake Game API**
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **YouTrack** for issue and sprint management
- **JavaScript** for the Battlesnake logic
- **Docker** for containerization
